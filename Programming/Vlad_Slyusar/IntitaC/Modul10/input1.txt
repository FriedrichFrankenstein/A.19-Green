On a certain afternoon in the late springtime the bell upon Tunstall Moat House was heard ringing at an unaccustomed
hour Far and near in the forest and in the fields along the river people began to desert their labours and hurry
towards the sound and in Tunstall hamlet a group of poor countryfolk stood wondering at the summons
Tunstall hamlet at that period in the reign of old King Henry VI wore much the same appearance as it wears to day
A score or so of houses heavily framed with oak stood scattered in a long green valley ascending from the river
At the foot the road crossed a bridge and mounting on the other side disappeared into the fringes of the forest on its
way to the Moat House and further forth to Holywood Abbey Half way up the village the church stood among yews
On every side the slopes were crowned and the view bounded by the green elms and greening oak trees of the forest
Hard by the bridge there was a stone cross upon a knoll and here the group had collected half a dozen women and one
tall fellow in a russet smock discussing what the bell betided An express had gone through the hamlet half an hour
before and drunk a pot of ale in the saddle not daring to dismount for the hurry of his errand but he had been ignorant
himself of what was forward and only bore sealed letters from Sir Daniel Brackley to Sir Oliver Oates the parson who
kept the Moat House in the master’s absence
But now there was the noise of a horse and soon out of the edge of the wood and over the echoing bridge there rode up
young Master Richard Shelton Sir Daniel’s ward He at the least would know and they hailed him and begged him to explain
He drew bridle willingly enough a young fellow not yet eighteen sun browned and grey eyed in a jacket of deer’s
leather with a black velvet collar a green hood upon his head and a steel cross bow at his back The express it appeared
had brought great news A battle was impending Sir Daniel had sent for every man that could draw a bow or carry a bill
to go post haste to Kettley under pain of his severe displeasure but for whom they were to fight or of where the battle
was expected Dick knew nothing Sir Oliver would come shortly himself and Bennet Hatch was arming at that moment for he
it was who should lead the party
